# MigraineBlog
Welcome to MigraineBlog!

This is a blog platform that allows users to create posts on 3 different migraine topics.
The user can add a single tag from a list of predetermined tags during the creation of their post.
More tags (though 1 at a time) can be added via the update post button, by selecting a different tag from the dropdown menu.

A navbar at the top of each page allows the user to move around this simple web app at their leisure.
